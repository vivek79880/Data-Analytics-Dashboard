# Data-Analytics-Dashboard
Project Objective:

The Data Analytics Dashboard is designed to help users upload, analyze, and visualize datasets effortlessly. It enables professionals and analysts to gain insights from structured data without requiring extensive coding skills. This project simulates real-world industry applications, such as:

1.Business Intelligence: Analyzing sales, revenue, and trends 
2.Data Science & Analytics: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Finance & Operations: Monitoring key performance metrics
4.This project is built using Streamlit (for an interactive UI), Pandas (for data manipulation), and Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization).

Features & Functionality:
1. Upload & Preview CSV Data
Users can upload a CSV(Excel) file, and the dashboard will display the first few rows for preview.

2. Data Summary & Statistics
The dashboard automatically generates summary statistics like mean, min, max, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

3. Correlation Heatmap
A heatmap visualizes relationships between numerical columns, highlighting strong correlations.

4. Distribution Analysis
Users can select any numerical column to generate a histogram with a KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) curve, helping identify trends and outliers.

5. Filtering & Data Selection
Users can filter data based on a categorical column to analyze subsets of data.

Tech Stack:
Python (Core language)
Streamlit (For an interactive web dashboard)
Pandas (For data handling)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (For visualizations)
